		You have told us your skin is dry so it is really important to keep it well hydrated, \
		protected and nourished with vitamins. A botanical moisturiser gives you the best of \
        both worlds; protecting skin from daily aggressors like the elements and damaging \
        free radicals as well as reducing moisture loss during the day and adding natural \
        nourishment. Based on our 3 active ingredient systems, Face Moisturiser is loaded \
        with skin-loving vitamin E plus algae, a superb natural humectant, which attracts \
        nourishment like a magnet to increase moisture levels. Laden with antioxidant \
        vitamins B and C to boost collagen and fight pigmentation plus magnesium and zinc \
        to strengthen and protect a weak epidermis, algae helps maintain cell membranes \
        too. \
        \n \
        To give thirsty skin an extra boost you may need to commit to using a treatment- \
        around 3 times a week is ideal. Loaded with botanical butters, Face Balm has been \
        specially developed to nourish and repair the skin’s upper layers as well as work \
        deeper down to help ‘feed’ healthy new cells where they are formed in the \
        epidermis. With shea butter – a concentrated source of oleic essential fatty acid to \
        encourage skin regeneration - cocoa seed butter, which is rich in phytochemicals and \
        forms a protective barrier over fragile skin, plus ultra hydrating and smoothing \
        hazelnut seed oil, it transforms dry skin overnight. Increase its moisture-drenching \
        capacity by applying using our intensely relaxing ‘Skin’ergy self-massage’, because \
        slow skin really is the perfect antidote to a fast world.',

        You have indicated that your skin is oily and this skin type needs thorough cleansing, \
        gentle exfoliation, balancing ingredients and moisturisation to minimise shine and \
        avoid breakouts. Keeping it clean by cleansing twice daily is essential for oily \
        complexions. As well as our 3 active ingredient systems, Face Wash uses botanical \
        alkaline cleansers and natural coconut to thoroughly clean deep down, banishing \
        excess sebum - which can often build up around nose and chin to create blackheads- \
        and whisk away dead skin cells. \
        \n \
        Oily skin really benefits from gentle exfoliation. Exfoliating Polish contains \
        detoxifying ginger essential oil, which is rich in sesquiterpenes to prevent \
        inflammation plus smoothing ginger threads to slough away impurities and sebum \
        build up. Anti-bacterial and antiseptic sweet orange reduces excess sebum and \
        breakouts without disrupting the skin’s delicate balance. Balancing essential oils are \
        ideal for skin prone to oiliness; products like our Facial Essence contain ylang ylang \
        essential oil. Known for its rebalancing properties to restore the skin’s equilibrium, \
        this soothing oil is loaded with potent anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and \
        antiseptic compounds such as linalool, geranyl and geraniol. Lemon verbena essence \
        is also antibacterial and anti-inflammatory making it ideal for treating blemishes. \
        \n \
        It’s a myth that oily skin doesn’t need moisturising; if you skip this step, skin will \
        conversely become more oily in an attempt to regulate itself. Use a light daily \
        nourisher such as Face Moisturiser, which we find also has an amazing mattifying \
        effect making a superb base for makeup.',

        You have informed us that your skin is combination so it’s key to care for both the \
        dry and oily areas of your complexion. This means sticking to a capsule regular \
        skincare routine, gentle exfoliation, moisturisation and using rebalancing \
        ingredients. This skin type needs gentle but consistent care to deal with an excess of \
        oil in some areas and dry patches in another. Regular cleansing is essential to help \
        counteract an oily T-zone and nourish drier areas. Face Wash blends coconut fatty \
        acids and alkaline cleansers to deep clean so thoroughly that skin feels squeaky- \
        clean and looks super bright. This may take a few uses to get used to but believe us \
        its balancing effects are incredible. All our products contain 3 active ingredient \
        systems to bring out the best in every skin type so follow with Facial Essence. It’s \
        loaded with vitamin E-rich hazelnut oil to nourish flaky areas plus rebalancing and \
        antiseptic essential oils to counteract shine. \
        \n \
        Finish with a botanical nourisher to seal in goodness and protect daylong. Sea algae \
        is amazing for drawing in moisture to dry areas; find it in products like our Face \
        Moisturiser which also helps regulate oiliness thanks to ylang ylang and lemon \
        verbena essences. Applying this rebalancing blend using our bespoke ‘Skin’ergy self- \
        massage’ – it’s like a facelift at your fingertips – to help improve lymph flow, detoxify \
        congested areas and bring fresh supplies of nourishment and nutrients to drier \
        zones. Once or twice a week use a rebalancing treatment mask. Mix equal parts Face \
        Balm with Exfoliating Polish to deeply nourish dry skin patches while gently \
        smoothing away a build up of pore-blocking dead skin cells and impurities for \

        You’ve clicked on sensitive skin, which needs gentle care, calming ingredients and \

        even down to water that’s too hot as this can strip skin of its protective lipid layer \
        aggravating sensitivity. Products containing botanicals are the best way forward as \
        they are closer to nature and therefore less likely to irritate angry skin further. All \
        our formulations are based on 3 active ingredient systems and are stringently \
        dermatologically tested to be kind to skin and suitable for every skin type. Essential \
        oils containing calming compounds such as azulene in chamomile and anti- \
        inflammatory lemon verbena in Face Wash and Facial Essence really help soothe \
        easily irritated skin types and ease redness. \
        \n \
		A weak epidermis means sensitive skin tends to be fragile, causing moisture to be \
        lost and allowing potential irritants to penetrate. Strengthening skin helps minimise \
        adverse reactions to changes in temperature, hormone levels and stress so look for \
        products featuring restorative ingredients to help repair its natural barrier function. \
        Rich in polyphenols to tighten, find regenerating magnesium and zinc in the marine \
        algae we use in Face Moisturiser. Daily use helps maintain cell membranes too for a \
        calmer, more resilient complexion. \
        \n \
        You can really boost resilience and evenness with a soothing nighttime treatment. \
        For softer, smoother and less irritated skin, massage in Face Balm. Loaded with \
        calming essentials oils and natural waxes like regenerating shea butter (rich in \
        essential fatty acids) and stabilising cocoa seed butter to soothe, its effects build up \
        over time as skin becomes stronger. Apply with our bespoke ‘Skin-ergy self-massage’ \

        its effects with simple facial massage that detoxifies skin of impurities that could \

        cellular renewal, which decreases as we age. 2-3 times a week detoxify skin with \
        Exfoliating Polish. Containing stimulating ginger essential oils and dried threads it \
        revitalises skin leaving it velvety smooth and glowing. For a nighttime treat, 3 times a \

        If your main aim is to improve an uneven skin tone, always begin with thorough \
        cleansing; it’s the foundation of healthy, clear skin. A fast world needs slow skin so \
        aside from good nutrition in your diet, essential fatty acids and minerals on your skin \
        will also help even out patches of colour or tone. Hazelnut seed oil is loaded with \
        them as well as skin-saving vitamins A, C and E. Vitamin E is a particularly powerful \
        anti-oxidant helping to neutralise free radicals and counter age and sun-related \
        pigmentation. Find it in Facial Essence and Face Balm along with 3 active ingredient \
        systems to bring skin into best possible condition. By applying these products using \
        our ‘Skin’ergy self-massage’ (which acts like a fingertip ‘facelift’) you’ll also increase \
